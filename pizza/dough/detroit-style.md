## Instructions

Add salt, sugar, and yeast to the water, stirring until all has dissolved.

Add the bread and semolina flour to the liquid, mixing and kneading until a shaggy dough forms.

Cover the dough, allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead again until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover, and allow to rest for 4 hours.

Coat pan(s) with olive oil. Gently stretch the dough into the edges and corners, cover, and let rest for 2 hours. If the dough shrinks back, allow it to relax for 15 minutes and stretch again.

Preheat the oven to 500˚F, with the pizza steel located on the lowest rack, for at least 1 hour.

Top pizza with thick-cut shredded cheese, high on the edges of the pan. Then top with additional toppings, being careful not to have the dough collapse under the weight of the toppings.

Transfer the pizza to the pizza steel in the oven, baking  until the cheese is bubbly with a dark edge, about 15 minutes.

Remove the pizza from the oven and run a spatula around the edges to loosen it from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board.

Cut the pizza to the desired number of slices, and then finish it off with sauce and/or other toppings.
